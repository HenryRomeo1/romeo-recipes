  <p>To go with this food, have you ever heard about...<strong>The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise
    was a "Sith Legend" </strong>that was shared with Anakin Skywalker by Supreme
    Chancellor Palpatine, who was secretly Darth Sidious. The tale told
    that Darth Plagueis, Sidious' Sith Master was so powerful and so wise
    that he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create
    life—which Plagueis could in fact do, and even save others from
    death, which he proved by killing and bringing back to life his own
    master's secret apprentice, Darth Venamis.
